🏠 Hyderabad House Price Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts house prices in Hyderabad based on key features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities. The model is trained on real estate datasets and helps buyers, sellers, and investors estimate property values with improved accuracy.

🚀 Features

Predict house prices based on multiple input features.

Data preprocessing with handling of missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations of price trends.

Multiple ML models implemented (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Comparison of model performance with metrics like R² score, MAE, RMSE.
